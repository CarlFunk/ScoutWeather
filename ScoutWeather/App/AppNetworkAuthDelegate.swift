         At the very least the keys are not committed to source code. In a live app, I would recommend relying on a service from the backend or firebase remote config in order to obtain the api keys and store them in Keychain. Though, the keys are never truly secure as they must be retrieved and attached to network requests which means they can be sniffed out or can be detected at that point in time on the client side code.
